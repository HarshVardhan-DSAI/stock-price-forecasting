Stock Price Forecasting with Time Series Analysis
Overview
This project demonstrates how to forecast stock prices using advanced time series techniques. It combines classical statistical models and modern machine learning approaches to analyze and predict stock market behavior using historical data.

Features
Download stock data from Yahoo Finance using yfinance.

Perform exploratory data analysis and visualize trends.

Test stationarity of the time series using Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) and KPSS tests.

Decompose time series into trend, seasonal, and residual components.

Build forecasting models using ARIMA, SARIMA, and Prophet.

Evaluate model performance with Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE).

Visualize auto-correlation and partial auto-correlation for parameter tuning.

Clean and well-documented code in a Jupyter notebook.
